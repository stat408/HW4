### Q1. Data Wrangling (2 points)

In your own words, describe data wrangling.

### Q2. Tidy Data (3 points)

Define a tidy dataset, then create and print a small data frame that __is not__ a tidy dataset.

### Q3. Merge (4 points)

Merge the two datasets.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
yelp <- read_csv("http://math.montana.edu/ahoegh/teaching/stat408/datasets/yelp_lasvegas_business.csv")

yelp_review <- read_csv("http://math.montana.edu/ahoegh/teaching/stat408/datasets/yelp_lasvegas_reviews_small.csv")
```

Then summarize how many 5 star reviews exist for the businesses on the `The Strip`. You can combine this across all of the different business IDs.

### Q4. Wide Datasets (3 points)

Create a small dataset and display this in wide format and long format.
