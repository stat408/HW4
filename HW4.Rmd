## Q1. Debugging Fuction (10 points)

Debug the following function, by rewritting the function below and demonstrating that the function calls specified below return the correct answer. For a short video of the Monty Hall problem see [from 21 with Kevin Spacey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr_xWfThjJ0) or [from numb3rs tv show](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjLwcvG1rTWAhUrsVQKHWq9CbEQyCkIKjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DP9WFKmLK0dc&usg=AFQjCNEYUi91dn4_xNLXQr9pESAdn9aApQ).

```{r, error= TRUE}
MontyHallMonteCarlo <- function(num.sims, print){
  # Function to simulate Monty Hall winning probability when switching doors
  # ARGS: number of simulations (as integer or double), print command
  #       that accepts TRUE or FALSE as to whether to print simulation results
  # Returns: list containing winning probability and (if print = TRUE)
  #          vector of results with strings "Win" or "Lose" for each simulation
  if (!num.spins %% 1 == 0) stop('Please enter an integer or double')
  results <- rep(FALSE,num.sims)
  for (i in 1:num.sims){
    # randomly choose door with car
    car.door <- sample(3,1)
    # randomly choose door for participant to select
    select.door <- sample(1,3)
    # you win when switching if the door with a car is not the
    # one you initally selected
    if (car.door = select.door) {
      results <- FALSE
    }
  }
  win.prob <- mean(results)
  ifelse(print, return(list(win.prob,results)),return(list(win.prob))
}

MonteHallMonteCarlo(8.1,print=T)
MonteHallMonteCarlo('8.1',print=T)
MonteHallMonteCarlo(8,print=T)
MonteHallMonteCarlo(10000,print=F)
```

## Q2. 4 points

In 2 or 3 sentences please describe Monte Carlo procedures and detail a setting where they are useful.
